1) Combine 5 and 6 for an 11 (only available option)

2) Yes, because there are only 4 ways to have a J, Q, and K, and if
3 cards remain, that must mean that there were an uneven amount of 
cards already played, meaning that 3 of the 4 J, Q, and K sets must
already have been played in order to get an uneven number, resulting
in all other pairs of 11 being played and 3 cards remaining; the last
J, Q, and K set.

3) I don't think there is really any strategy whatsoever. If you have
more than one possible play at any given time, if you make one play, you
can immediately follow it with the other, meaning that no matter which one you choose the same result will follow, so there is no strategy.
